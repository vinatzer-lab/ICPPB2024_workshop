Genomics and Metagenomics workshop for pathogen identification

- ### Part1: Intro to pathogen indetification
  This module convers the methods used for sequencing and sample collection and a general workflow for pathogen identifcation.

- ### Part2: Genome-based pathogen identification
  This module introduces LINs and GenomeRxiv as a method for genome-based pathogen identification.

- ### Part3: Intro to metagenome-based pathogen identification using LINtax
  This module covers metagenome classification and introduces LINtax as a method for metagenome-based pathogen identification.
